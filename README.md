# **CS 513 - Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Assignments 🚀**  

## 📌 Course Overview  
This repository contains assignments for **CS 513 - Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining**, covering fundamental and advanced topics in machine learning, data preprocessing, model evaluation, and visualization.  

## 🔥 Key Features  
✔ **Python Implementation**: Solutions written in Python using industry-standard libraries.  
✔ **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, transforming, and analyzing real-world datasets.  
✔ **Supervised & Unsupervised Learning**: Implementing regression, classification, clustering, and more.  
✔ **Model Evaluation**: Performance metrics and visualizations for better insights.  
✔ **Well-Structured Code**: Each assignment is well-documented and follows best coding practices.  

## 🛠 Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **NumPy & Pandas** (Data Manipulation)  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data Visualization)  
- **Scikit-Learn** (Machine Learning)  

## 📊 How It Works  
1. Each assignment is saved in its respective folder (e.g., `HW1`, `HW2`, etc.).  
2. Code is implemented in Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) and Python scripts (`.py`).  
3. Datasets used for assignments are included where applicable.  
4. Plots and results are generated to support analyses and conclusions.  

## 🚀 Installation & Usage  

### Prerequisites:  
Ensure you have **Python 3.7+** installed along with the required libraries:  

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```  

Alternatively, install all dependencies using:  

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```  

### Running Assignments:  
- Open Jupyter Notebook:  
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook
  ```
- Run a specific assignment:  
  ```bash
  python assignment_name.py
  ```

## 📌 Example Output  
- **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning Results**  
- **Model Training & Evaluation Metrics**  
- **Clustering & Visualization Plots**  

## 🎯 Future Improvements
